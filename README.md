## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) or another Web3 wallet
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you want to run a local development server)
- Some ETH in your wallet for transactions (can use testnet ETH)

## üíª Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-ecommerce-dapp.git
   cd blockchain-ecommerce-dapp
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or set up a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Node.js and http-server (optional)
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

3. Configure your smart contract:
   - Deploy the e-commerce smart contract to Ethereum (main net or test net)
   - Update the contract address in `script.js`
   - Verify the ABI matches your deployed contract

## ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Contract Configuration

To connect the frontend to your smart contract:

1. Open `script.js` and locate these lines:
   ```javascript
   const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with deployed contract address
   const contractABI = YOUR_ABI_HERE; // Replace with contract ABI JSON
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with your deployed contract address
3. Replace `YOUR_ABI_HERE` with your contract's ABI (already included in the repo)

## üì± Usage

### Connecting Your Wallet

## üîß Customization

### Changing Personal Details
1. Open `index.html` and locate the header section to update:
   - Your name and title

   ```css
   :root {
       --glass-primary: #6A5AE0;    /* Primary color */
       --glass-secondary: #FF8A65;  /* Secondary color */
       --glass-accent: #16C2D5;     /* Accent color */
       /* More color variables... */
   }
   ```

## üåê Network Configuration

The platform can work with different Ethereum networks:

- **Mainnet**: For production use with real transactions
- **Testnet** (Goerli, Sepolia): For testing without using real ETH
- **Local Blockchain**: For development (Ganache, Hardhat)

To change networks:
1. Switch networks in your MetaMask wallet
2. Reconnect to the application
3. Ensure your contract is deployed on the selected network
